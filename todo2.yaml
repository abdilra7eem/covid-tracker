			#- change backend validator to use 'email' rule instead of regex
		# - phone number: 
			# - allow "x" for extensions & " " (spacebar) in user & directorate primary_phone
			# - change max length to 18 in user & directorate primary_phone
			# - more permissive spacebar & length for user secondary_phone, and incident phones
