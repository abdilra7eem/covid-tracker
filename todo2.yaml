Incident Controller:
	- index: Filters for
		- directorate @admin
		- school [@admin & @supervisor]
SchoolClosure Controller:
	- index: filters for
		- directorate @admin
		- school [@admin & @supervisor]
		- close_type: admin, staff, partial
		
Features:
	- Later: link on "phone_number" & "email"

Security:
	- Later: double check user edit permissions

Bugs: 
	- abort(403) to Soft-error messages with redirect
	- delete is a toggle; multiple calls could result in undesireable effect. Should have a status.
	- delete is preventing back button; should be Ajax.
	- reopening: fix checkbox bug
	#- school user: /user index hide deactivated accounts
	#- user.show:
		#- if school:
			#- change 'اسم المشرف' to 'اسم المدرسة'
			#- نوع الحساب
			#- text-danger: الحساب لمدرسة ليس لها ملف
	#- schoolClosure index:
		#- add pagination
		#- fix type=partial bug
	#- hide buttons in printing
	- add page titles


Integrity:
	- Do not allow creating new incident records (based on person_id) for:
		- people who died
		- people who have a record that is still not closed
		#- problems:
			#- what if person_id is unknown at time of creation (must be available)
				#- when updating, create an anomaly alert ? (Do not allow creation)
			#- information leakage based on person_id (mitigated)
	- Do not allow creating new closure, if grade section is closed:
		- validate grade & section for partial
		- validate grade for >12

Accountability:
	# - last_editor_ip: migration, factory, show (for admins), create & update save.

#Editing: according to editin-permissions.yaml

Performance:
	- try to avoide double sorting in closure

UI/UX:
	closure:
		- filters:
			- deleted (sort by updated_at)
			- open (sort by reopening_date)
		- filter links
	school:
		- filter:
			- locked
			- no data
		- filter links
	incident:
		- filters & links
	deleted:
		- filters & links
