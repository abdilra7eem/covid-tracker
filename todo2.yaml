Incident Controller:
	- index: Filters for
		- directorate @admin
		- school [@admin & @supervisor]
SchoolClosure Controller:
	- index: filters for
		#- directorate @admin
		- school [@admin & @supervisor]
		#- close_type: complete, partial

Bugs: 
	- abort(403) to Soft-error messages with redirect
	- delete is a toggle; multiple calls could result in undesireable effect. Should have a status.
	- delete is preventing back button; should be Ajax.
	- reopening: fix checkbox bug
	- add page titles

Integrity:
	#- Do not allow creating new incident records (based on person_id) for:
		#- people who died
		#- people who have a record that is still not closed
	#- Do not allow creating new closure, if grade section is closed:
		#- validate grade & section for partial
		#- validate grade for >12
	#- incident edit: fo not allow changing person_id

Accountability:

Performance:
	- try to avoide double sorting in closure

UI/UX:
	closure:
		- filters:
			- deleted (sort by updated_at)
			- open (sort by reopening_date)
		- filter links
	school:
		- filter:
			- locked
			- no data
		- filter links
	incident:
		- filters & links
	deleted:
		- filters & links
